# CS3035 â€“ Course Project Description

## Description of Your Project

Below, provide a short description of what your project is, how it works, and why you selected this as your project.

## Requirements

- How/What different views did you provide for some aspect of your model?
There are quite a few sub-views. There is a task list view (for showing the sublists of tasks). There's also a task view for showing all the tasks. There are some smaller views, like the task buttons and list button.

- What custom widget did you create in your application?
I created a custom checkmark widget. I also created custom panes for both the task and list buttons. Though I used FXML to load in the visual side, so I'm not sure if it counts.

- What are the different domain objects that can be created/edited in your application?
You can create a new task, delete a task. You can create a list, rename a list, and delete a list.

- What parts of the application/project did you find particularly challenging? And, what would you have liked to improve?
I found just creating anything in JavaFX to be frustrating. I have used Flutter, which is component-based like React, and it felt so much more intuitive to quickly create functional interfaces. Creating interfaces in JavaFX felt cluttered and unnatural. It was frustrating getting all views to be synchronized and functioning properly (e.g. if a task from List 2 is deleted, the list of tasks should be updated in All Tasks views). I would have liked to add some more features or make it visually more appealing with some animations, but could not get around to it.

- Any  other comments on the course project?
No other comments.
