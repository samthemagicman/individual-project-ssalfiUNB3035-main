# CS 3035 - Individual Project - Fall 2022

## Project Description
In this project you will put what you have learned in class into practice, and extend what you have learned to create a 
desktop app that allows editing different objects.

Your project is to be completed individually.

## Due Date
***November 29, 2022***

## Requirements

You will select an application area for your project that is of interest to you, but that fulfills the requirements below.

### Implementation Requirements

- You will use/adapt the sketching methods discussed in class to your project (see slides from our sketching video lecture; you can use a 5+5 method)
  - https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/25957d44-b5a6-489d-93c5-fa83f5123a56
- Your application must use an MVC design
- Your application should provide at least two different views for some aspect of your model
- Your application should have a splash screen, a menu bar (with appropriate content), a Help menu
- The Help Menu should include a Help Screen, and an About that Displays your "company logo" and your name
- Your application must provide a consistent and appropriate look and feel (i.e., colors, fonts, etc.) for your project
- Your application should contain at least one custom designed widget that appropriately allows you to enter and display information about some aspect of your domain objects
- Your application should allow interacting and entering model information for at least 3 different types of domain objects (e.g., a calendar app might allow you to create/edit/delete users, meetings, and holidays)
- Domain objects should be able to be created, edited/updated/changed and deleted as appropriate through user or system actions
- Provide a set of exemplary domain objects that are pre-populated in your application
- Your application does not need to save its updated state when it is closed (i.e., the system will return to its original state upon restarting)
- Be creative - some points will be reserved for the complexity/creativity of the projects, but do not go too far

### Example Project Ideas

- A media organization/player app
- The ultimate todo app
- A personal budgeting app
- A simple 2D RPG game
- A tool to create RPG characters or plan simple campaigns
- A data charting tool... enter data and create charts
- Recreate an app you like in JavaFX
- Your own idea! If in doubt check with Scott.

### Project Deliverables

- a completed AUTHORS.md file 
- a short one-page report describing your project, available in REPORT.md
- a video demonstration of your app (no longer than 3.5 mins long, if it's shorter that's fine). The video can be narrated, but should demonstrate all the main functionality of your app. Upload your videos to Streams and share the link in your report.

## Resources
- [JavaFX Splash Screen](https://www.genuinecoder.com/javafx-splash-screen-loading-screen/)

## Assessment

- Points will be awarded based on meeting the requirements above, providing a fully working, bug/error free system that follows basic principles of usability discussed in the lectures.

- A small portion of the projects grade will be awarded for creativity/complexity of your project (~10%)
